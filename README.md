## How to build

### Prerequisites:
 * git 2.40.1 or higher (GIT Bash on Windows)
 * CMake 3.26.4 or higher
 * A C++ compiler with C++23 support (gcc 13.1, clang 17.0.1, MSVC 19.30) or higher

### Building 
#### 1. Start by cloning the repository by SSH
``` sh
git clone git@github.com:aeris170/NeoDoa.git
```
or by HTTPS
``` sh
git clone https://github.com/aeris170/NeoDoa.git
```

When cloning is done, go into the cloned folder and initialize submodules
``` sh
cd NeoDoa
git submodule update --init
```

After this, `git pull` should print `Already up to date.` Proceed to the next step.

#### 2. Fetching Required Installations (Linux ONLY)

**If you are using Windows, please skip this step.**

**NeoDoa** requires various installations from `apt-get` to compile. These are listed below:
> build-essential
> curl zip unzip tar
> pkg-config
> libxinerama-dev
> libxcursor-dev
> xorg xorg-dev
> libglu1-mesa libglu1-mesa-dev
> autoconf autoconf-archive
>

These can either be install manually or by launching the helper script by executing:
```sh
sh FetchAptGet.sh
```

#### 3. Fetching Dependencies

**NeoDoa** uses `vcpkg` to manage packages and depends on packages listed below: 
> angelscript[addons]
> argparse
> assimp
> imgui[core,docking-experimental,glfw-binding,opengl3-binding]
> imguizmo
> entt
> eventpp
> glew 
> glfw3
> glm
> icu
> lunasvg
> stb
> tinyxml2

The packages above must be installed by launching the helper script [`FetchDependencies.sh`](https://github.com/aeris170/NeoDoa/blob/master/FetchDependencies.sh). This script takes two arguments
`platform` and `clonemode`. `platform` defaults to `x64-windows` and can be overriden to `x64-linux` or your OS of choosing
by passing it as the first argument. `clonemode` governs how the script should try to clone `vcpkg` repository. Passing nothing
defaults to `https`, only `https` and `ssh` are accepted.

Examples:
```sh
sh FetchDependencies.sh                  # Fetch packages for x64-windows using https
sh FetchDependencies.sh x64-windows ssh  # Fetch packages for x64-windows using ssh (must have an ssh key set-up)
sh FetchDependencies.sh x64-linux        # Fetch packages for x64-linux   using https (doesn't work on our test systems)
sh FetchDependencies.sh x64-linux ssh    # Fetch packages for x64-linux   using ssh (must have an ssh key set-up)
```

You should see no errors when this scripts completes. If you do, please create an issue [here](https://github.com/aeris170/NeoDoa/issues).

#### 4. Building with CMake

Building the makefile (or Visual Studio Project) CMake should be done with the commands below:

For Windows:
```sh
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
```
For Linux:
```sh
mkdir build
cd build
cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release .. # Debug or Release
```

#### OR

There are also the helper scripts [`cmake.sh`](https://github.com/aeris170/NeoDoa/blob/master/cmake.sh) to execute the commands above.

For Windows:
```sh
sh cmake.sh
```
For Linux:
```sh
sh cmakeLinuxDebug.sh # OR sh cmakeLinuxRelease.sh
```

#### 5. Building!

If you built to a makefile, what's left is calling `make`

```sh
make
```

If you build to Visual Studio Project, boot up a Visual Studio of your choosing and press F5.
